						<t2>Why you should contribute to Ubuntu</t2>
						<p>
							If someone asks me which is the best part of being involved in Ubunt project, I answer: “The fun!“. Seriously.
I believe that many people could collaborate with Ubunt project, so let’s move to the reasons why you should try to collaborate for yourself.
							<t4>Friends</t4>
							<p class="quote">« We’re all working together; that’s the secret! »</p>
							<p>When you start, you meet a lot of awesome people, with whom you become friends, rather than colleague. This is one of great thing of the community: you can often have a chat just to know each other better.
The first day you'll join IRC, you will meet people always available and always with a word of support or a compliment. He helps you to acclimate and get to know other members of the team, and helps you to learn a lot of thing about software developement, group work and much much more.
It’s nice to be part of such a great family that works for a common goal: the users’ freedom. ;)</p>

							<t4>Knowledge</t4>
							<p class="quote">« Knowledge makes people special. Knowledge enriches life itself »</p>
							<p>Collaboration with Ubuntu project gives you much more than what you gives: contribute wrtiting code gives you knowledge. 
When you start with Ubuntu you'll maybe didn’t know anything of C programming language. but  you'll be proficient in C, and you'll have improved also other skills, like group work, be familary with tools used to communicate between contributers, “think like a programmer”.
So, if you decide to collaborate to Ubuntu project, you’ll learn many things that will enrich your cultural background and, maybe, one day will come in handy. Not only code, but also mentality, visions of the world: meet new people is always constructive.</p>

							<t4>Fun</t4>
							<p class="quote">« Find a job you love and you’ll never work a day in your life »</p>
							<p>To contribute on an ongoing basis to Ubuntu, it should be fun for you : if you do it grudgingly, or under duress, you will not like and this affected both the quality of your work and your relationship with others.
You'll find in Ubuntu, a project where you can have fun: it'll be a pleasure for you to return to home after a day at the university and have the possibility to write code, fix bugs and so on.
 The ambiance is nice: sure, there are deadlines and things less fun (like tests :-P) but the result gives a lot of satisfactions.</p>

 							<t4>A common goal</t4>
							<p class="quote">« Arise! Awake! And stop not until the goal is reached »</p>
							<p>Another awesome thing of the Ubunt project is the spirit that moves people: you can see that is not only a work, but it’s a hope to do something good for the world. Yes, a software isn't the most important thing in the world, but the idea of freedom is. So, in a market where the only company which works for “open-source” is Google, the hope to do the difference is very strength. And this is reflected in the quality of relationships: everyone is always available to help you, even outside working hours, and there is a lot of enthusiasm.</p>

							<p>Some suggestion to start to contribute to a project:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Know the people, make some friends, work together, based on the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.</li>
								<li>Diverse: from 14-year old students to retired computing pioneers, reaches out to <a href="http://wiki.ubuntu-women.org/">ubuntu women</a>, etc. </li>
								<li>Low barriers to entry, good tools for contributors</li>
								<li>Multi-lingual</li>
								<li>Worldwide network of <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeams">Local Teams</a></li>
								<li>Meritocracy via open processes</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Community Council</li>
									<li>Technical Board</li>
									<li>Core Developers (~50) with "commit" rights on "main" (supported packages). Perhaps half of the core team works for Canonical.</li>
									<li>Masters of the Universe (~100) with "commit" rights on "universe". "universe" is the category of Ubuntu packages which is available but not supported by Canonical.</li>
									<li>Ubuntu Members (~336)</li>
									<li>Ubunteros (~6000) - signed the Code of Conduct</li>
									<li>Also 1 "SABDFL" (Self-Appointed Benevolent Dictator For Life), Mark Shuttleworth, but he leaves nearly all decisions to the community.</li>
								</ul>
							</ul>

							<p>Congrats, you are now a part of a big family, and you do something to make the world better ;-)</p>
